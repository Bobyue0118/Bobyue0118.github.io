Hiüëã, I‚Äôm currently a first year PhD student at [the School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), supervised by Prof. [Guiliang Liu](https://guiliang.me/). Before, I received both my B.Eng (2021) and M.Eng degrees (2024) at [the Department of Automation](https://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interest includes: 

- Inverse Constraint Inference (ICI) from expert demonstrations
- Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL)
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Embodied AI

For discussions or collaborations, feel free to drop me an email!

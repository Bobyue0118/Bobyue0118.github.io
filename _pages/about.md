I‚Äôm a first year PhD student at [the School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), supervised by Prof. [Guiliang Liu](https://guiliang.me/). Before, I received my both B.Eng and M.Eng degrees at [the Department of Automation](https://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interest includes Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Embodied AI.

For discussions or collaborations, feel free to drop me an email!
